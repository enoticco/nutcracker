Meanwhile, the godfather, smiling affectionately, took Marie on his knees and said, stroking her head:

"Don't listen to them, my little Marie!" God has given you more than all of us! You, like my Pirlipatchen in a fairy tale, were born a princess and know how to rule in a wonderful, beautiful kingdom, as for your Nutcracker, you will have to endure a lot of grief because of him: the mouse king pursues him everywhere; not me, but you alone can save him, be only persistent and devoted! 

Neither Marie nor anyone present could guess what the godfather wanted to say with these words, and this speech seemed so strange to the medical adviser that he even felt the godfather's pulse and said:

“Hey, dear friend, it looks like you have a rush of blood to your head, I’ll prescribe something for you.”

Only the adviser shook her head in thought and said quietly:

I think I can guess what he wants to say, but I just can't put it into words.
